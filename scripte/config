# ALSA output settings.  If you need to dump the audio produced by MOC
# to a file for diagnostic purposes, the following setting of 'ALSADevice'
# should do that:
#
#    ALSADevice=tee:hw,'/tmp/out.wav',wav
#
#ALSADevice = default
#ALSAMixer1 = PCM
#ALSAMixer2 = Master

# Under some circumstances on 32-bit systems, audio played continously
# for long periods of time may begin to stutter.  Setting this option to
# 'yes' will force MOC to avoid ALSA's dmix resampling and prevent this
# stutter.  But it also has other implications:
#
# - You may experience unacceptably high CPU load.
# - ALSA's resampler plug-ins will not be used.
# - The resampling may be of lower quality than ALSA would provide.
# - You may need to try different "ResampleMethod" option settings.
# - The "ForceSampleRate" option may be ineffective.
# - If libsamplerate is not configured, many audios may be unplayable.
